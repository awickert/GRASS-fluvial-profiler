# Cross-check: `rivernetworkx.divides` vs TopoToolbox `DIVIDEobj`

Development/testing harness that certifies the `rivernetworkx.divides`
drainage-divide network against the reference implementation, **TopoToolbox
`DIVIDEobj`**, by running both on *identical* flow routing and comparing the
divide edge set and Topo ordering.

## Why a controlled (shared-routing) comparison

A divide network is the dual of the drainage basins, which depend entirely on the
flow routing. To isolate the *divide construction* from any routing difference
(the lesson from the LSDTopoTools comparison — routing method dominates), we route
**once**, in the dreich pipeline, and feed those exact D8 receivers to TopoToolbox
as a sparse giver→receiver matrix `M` via `FLOWobj(M, …)`. Both tools then build
divides on the same basins.

## Result (Big Tujunga 30 m, 300×400 window, stream threshold 200 cells)

Opening each basin loop **at its outlet** (the faithful `getdivide`;
`outlet_trim_experiment.py`) reproduces TopoToolbox's divide network:

| construction | recall | precision | Jaccard | (interior, ≥12 from edge) |
|--------------|----:|----:|----:|---|
| all-channel trim (over-removes near-stream) | 0.886 | 0.960 | 0.854 | r 0.920 / p 0.974 |
| **outlet-only trim (= getdivide)** | **0.943** | 0.953 | 0.902 | **r 0.984 / p 0.967 / J 0.952** |

In the interior the outlet-trim matches TopoToolbox at **98.4 % recall / 96.7 %
precision** — a faithful reproduction. The remaining boundary gap is the Octave
shims + `outlets=false` + window clipping. The Topo-order *tail* still diverges
(max 25 vs 38; it is +1 per junction, so segmentation differences compound) even
though the edges agree — a separate, smaller item.

## Routing is identical (the residual is construction, not routing)

`routing_check.py` confirms TopoToolbox's `flowacc` on `FLOWobj(M)` equals
dreich's `ncontrib` for **100 % of cells** (max|diff| = 0). Since `flowacc` is a
strict function of the receiver tree, the routing is provably identical — the
`M` hand-off works exactly. So the divide residual is purely the *construction
algorithm*, not the flow routing.

## What the residual is (`residual_analysis.py`)

| set | edges | near a stream (≤1 cell) | order-1 |
|-----|------:|---:|---:|
| MISS (TopoToolbox has, I lack) | 1849 | **56 %** (median dist 0) | 66 % |
| EXTRA (I have, TopoToolbox lacks) | 604 | 19 % (median dist 3.6) | 96 % |
| SHARED (the ridge network) | 14342 | 9 % (median dist 7) | — |

The recall gap is dominated by **near-stream** edges: my `stream=` trim *removes
every channel-adjacent edge*, whereas `getdivide` *keeps* the basin perimeter and
opens each loop only at its single **outlet**. So the trim is a simplification of
`getdivide` that over-removes near-stream order-1 leaves; the per-link basins also
add a few deep spurs (the precision gap). The ridge network — what matters for
first-order valleys and channel heads — agrees.

## Reproduce

```bash
# 1. clone the reference (GPL; not vendored here) and make it Octave-runnable
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wschwanghart/topotoolbox.git /tmp/topotoolbox
TTB=/tmp/topotoolbox bash apply_octave_patches.sh

# 2. route + build M + compute my divides (writes /tmp/ttb_M.mat, /tmp/ttb_mine_edges.npy)
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/r.fluvial /usr/bin/python3 build_M.py

# 3. run TopoToolbox DIVIDEobj on that routing (writes /tmp/ttb_out_*.txt)
TTB=/tmp/topotoolbox SHIMS=$PWD/octave_shims octave --no-gui --quiet run_divideobj.m

# 4. compare
/usr/bin/python3 compare.py
```

Needs Octave with the `image` and `statistics` packages
(`apt install octave-image octave-statistics`).

## Octave compatibility shims/patches (all faithful or boundary-only)

TopoToolbox targets MATLAB; these make a clone run under Octave without changing
any algorithm:

- **`octave_shims/bwtraceboundary.m`** — Octave lacks `bwtraceboundary`; shimmed
  via `bwboundaries`. Returns the same boundary loop with a different start/
  direction, but the undirected boundary *edge set* (all that getdivide needs) is
  identical.
- **`octave_shims/verLessThan.m`** — returns `false` (assume modern MATLAB; pure
  version gate, no algorithm content).
- **`apply_octave_patches.sh`** edits the clone:
  - `polygon2GRIDobj` → force the non-`polyshape` `poly2mask` branch (Octave has
    no `polyshape`). Only used by `getdivide` for **edge-outlet** basins, so it
    affects window-boundary divides only.
  - `unique(…)` 3rd output (inverse map `ic`) computed via `ismember` — Octave
    does not implement it for `'stable'`/`'rows'`; `ismember` gives the exact
    MATLAB values.
  - `divorder.m`: rename variable/field `do` → `dvo` (`do` is an Octave keyword).
- **`run_divideobj.m`** uses `'outlets', false`: TopoToolbox's edge-outlet
  `getdivide` path indexes a 2nd neighbour that may not exist on a clipped window.

Because the `polyshape`/edge-outlet items touch the boundary, the comparison
reports the **interior** separately as the fair test of the core construction.
